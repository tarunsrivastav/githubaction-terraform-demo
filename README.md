This GitHub repository contains the configuration for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform whenever a push event occurs in the repository.

Overview
The CI/CD pipeline is triggered whenever a new commit or push event occurs in the GitHub repository. It utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process, integrating seamlessly with your development workflow.

Workflow Steps
The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following steps:

Checkout: The pipeline checks out the latest code from the repository to the GitHub Actions runner.

Terraform Init: Initializes the Terraform configuration by downloading the required providers and modules.

Terraform Plan: Generates an execution plan for Terraform to review the changes that will be applied.

Terraform Apply: Applies the Terraform execution plan to create or update the AWS EC2 instance.

Verify Deployment: Performs post-deployment verification checks to ensure the instance is successfully provisioned.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage EC2 instances.
Terraform installed on the GitHub Actions runner or available in the repository.
GitHub repository with Terraform configuration files and necessary IAM roles.
Getting Started
To set up the CI/CD pipeline for deploying an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform, follow these steps:

Clone Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

Configure Terraform: Update the Terraform configuration files (*.tf) with your AWS provider settings, EC2 instance details, and any other required configurations.

GitHub Secrets: Add your AWS access key ID and secret access key as secrets in the GitHub repository settings. This ensures secure authentication with AWS during the deployment process.

GitHub Actions Workflow: Create or update the GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/main.yml) with the steps required to deploy the EC2 instance using Terraform. You can customize the workflow according to your requirements.

Test and Deploy: Commit your changes and push them to the GitHub repository. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which will provision the EC2 instance using Terraform.

Verify Deployment: Once the deployment is complete, verify that the EC2 instance is successfully provisioned and functioning as expected in the AWS Management Console.

Example Workflow Configuration
Here's an example GitHub Actions workflow configuration (main.yml) for deploying an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform:

yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy EC2 Instance

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy EC2 Instance
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.0.0

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan -out=tfplan

      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan

      - name: Verify Deployment
        run: |
          # Add verification steps here (e.g., ping instance, perform smoke tests)
